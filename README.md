This project is a basic calculator.\
It allows users to perform simple arithmetic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with some additional functions like square root, power, and factorial.\
The calculator has a memory feature that can store and retrieve numbers from the browser's local storage. Users can add or subtract the current result from the memory using the "M+" and "M-" buttons, respectively.\
The input is processed as an expression, and the result is evaluated using the JavaScript eval() function. If the input expression contains any invalid character or syntax, the calculator will display an error message in the result field.
